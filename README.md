# FurScraper - Username webscraper test
This is a proof of concept username webscraper for Furaffinity

When run, a user can supply a username and output path of a non private furaffinity user account.
After that, all usernames that that account follows will be written to said file.

Please note that this is proof of concept code and it should only be used for learning the beautifulsoup4 package in Python.
NOTE: I highly do not recommend to use it on the real website.
